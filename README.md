=================
This is a packaging build that puts together a distributable build of the following, on all the operating systems we support:
* transputer-emulator
* transputer-macro-assembler
* transputer-eforth (in a forthcoming release)

It runs on Apple macOS (El Capitan+), Windows 10, CentOS 7.6, Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 and Raspbian Stretch.

It is part of the [Parachute Project](https://devzendo.github.io/parachute).

Status
------
First release 0.0.1 Midsummer 2019 (14 June 2019).

In active development.

Roadmap
-------
First release:
* Ported to macOS (El Capitan +), Linux (Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7.6, Raspbian Stretch), Windows 10.
* A Cross Platform system that can run "Hello World" (via my NodeServer implementation).

Release Notes
-------------
transputer-emulator
===================
0.0.1 First Release
* Versioning and build now controlled by Maven and CMake.
* Successfully runs hello2.asm !
* Renamed emulator binary from t800emul to temulate.
* Started adding the T801 instructions, from "Transputer Instruction Set - Appendix, Guy Harriman".
* Started adding the T801/T805 instructions from "Support for debugging/breakpointing in transputers" (INMOS
  Technical Note 61).
  Added the -j flag to enable 'j 0' breakpoints.
* Described current implementation/missing status in the above section.
* The T810 instructions from "The IMS T810 - A Preliminary Survey" are not implemented.
* Builds using Maven/CMake/CLion on macOS, Windows 10, CentOS 7, Ubuntu LTS, Raspbian Stretch.
* Added Boot-from-ROM, fixed Wdesc bug after boot from link.
* Fixes: xword, call, j & scheduling (with assistance from Michael Br√ºstle), locations of TPtrLoc1, TPtrLoc0.
  csngl and xdble: correct detection of sign of Areg
* Monitor: db (renamed from da), dw improvements, added w (workspace display), added b/b+b-/b? (breakpoints),
  added s (show all state).
* Adopted the Apache License v2.
* Since the assembler understands offset addressing, the manual building of offset operands has been changed from:
  j 'label - _XX1'
  _XX1:
  to:
  j label

transputer-macro-assembler
==========================
0.0.1 First release
* Bugfix: Any offsets to symbols in direct instructions (which required offset transformation) were not
  appearing in the listing, despite being generated correctly by the StatementTransformers.
* Bugfix: Offsets are generated relative to the start of the instruction, so a sequence of DDs:
  DD OFFSET X, OFFSET X, OFFSET X
  now yields three distinct values, rather than three copies of the offset of the first DD from X.
* Bugfix: Negative Constant/Variable definition in listing only shows 16-bit versions of values? eg for 0x80000070 -
  now correctly shows 0x80000070.
* Added an OFFSET operator, to compute offsets of its argument from $.
* Added support for the full T414/T800/T801/T805 instruction set in .TRANSPUTER mode.
* Added the T801 instructions, from "Transputer Instruction Set - Appendix, Guy Harriman".
* Added the T801/T805 instructions from "Support for debugging/breakpointing in transputers" (INMOS
  Technical Note 61).
* Added the Parachute Transputer Emulator's nonstandard instructions.
* Correct offset generation for j, cj, call direct instructions - so you don't have to specify OFFSET to a symbolic
  argument, it's implied.
* Builds on macOS, Windows 10 and Linux (Various).
